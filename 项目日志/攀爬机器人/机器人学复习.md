# Spatial descriptions and transformations
## Description of a position
## Description od an orientation
We denote the unit vectors giving the principal directrions of coordinate system $\{B\}$ as $\hat{X}_B$,$\hat{Y}_B$ and $\hat{Z}_B$. When written in terms of coordinate system $\{A\}$, they are called ${}^A\hat{X}_B$,${}^A\hat{Y}_B$ and ${}^A\hat{Z}_B$.
Stack three unit vectors together as the columns of a $3X3$ matrix, in the order ${}^A\hat{X}_B$,${}^A\hat{Y}_B$ ,${}^A\hat{Z}_B$.We will call this matrix as a **rotation matrix**.
Each component of **rotation matrix** can be written as the dot product of a pair of unit vectors.
$$
{}^A_BR = [{}^A\hat{X}_B\  {}^A\hat{Y}_B\ {}^A\hat{Z}_B] = \begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} &  r_{12 } & r_{13} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## 平移坐标的变换
$$
{}^AP = {}^BP + {}^AP_{B\ ORG}
$$

## 旋转坐标的变换
$$
{}^A_BR={}^B_AR^{-1}={}^A_BR^T
$$
$$
{}^AP = {}^A_BR{}^BP
$$
