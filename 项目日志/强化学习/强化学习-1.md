# Reinforcement Learning
- In the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards.

- These two characteristics—trial-and-error search and delayed reward—are the two most important distinguishing features of reinforcement learning.

# Elements of Reinforcement Learning
Beyond the agent and the environment, one can identify four main subelements of a reinforcement learning system: a policy, a reward signal , a value function, and, optionally, a model of the environment.
- policy
- reward signal: A policy defines the learning agent’s way of behaving at a given time.
- value function: A reward signal defines the goal of a reinforcement learning problem.Whereas the reward signal indicates what is good in an immediate sense, a value function specifies what is good in the long run.
- optionally, a model of the environment.
